### Dependencies

You'll need some more dependencies to create builds.

See the `electron-builder` wiki page: [Multi Platform Build](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Multi-Platform-Build)

On linux you'll need a few more deps:

```
sudo apt-get install icnsutils graphicsmagick xz-utils
```

```
npm install 7zip-bin-linux
```

(**WARNING - looks like `7zip-bin` is being fancy** .. the package-lock Matt uploaded has `7zip-bin-mac` in in)

$ cd ticktack-builder
$ npm run update
$ npm run release
```

Output to `./dist`
